  <section class="post-content"><p>Yes, I did it, and I have to say that it was one of the most exciting
hack experiences that I have had. But let us start in the beginning,
four years ago. At that time, a friend and I was writing some toys
related to operating systems. He was a C programmer, but knowing that
nobody even will try our system, I wanted to have some extra fun!  I
convinced him to embed a Forth in the kernel. I did not know anything
about Forth, but it promised to be interesting. I picked up
<a href="https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/lnmaurer/web/forth/Forth-79.pdf">an old specification of the Forth language</a>
and implement it in assembler for x86. It became a retro-software
project. However, he moved to other projects and the project stopped.</p>

<p>A couple of years later, I found the code again. I have not any other
thing to work in, so I chose to give it a try. I ported my original
implementation to 32 bits and I integrated the Forth implementation
with the C kernel. Once that I could write programs on it, I replaced
C and grew the language with many words. I wrote output routines, a
serial driver, keyboard and a video driver, memory management,
exceptions, timer... It was so fun that I could not stop there and I
wrote a speaker driver, an assembler and disassembler, trace/untrace
utilities, a Sokoban game taken from
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gforth/">GForth</a>, emacs keybindings and
autocompletion in the terminal like in readline, and a simple Lisp
interpreter! Did I say how great growing the system from scratch was?</p>

<h3>Try Eulex</h3>

<p>The first thing you have to do is make sure you have a recent Qemu
installation. It has to be enough recent to support multiboot
kernels. Just installing the version of your distribution should
work. Now, get the source code from the repository</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">git clone https://github.com/davazp/eulex.git
</code></pre></div>
<p>Move to the directory where it was cloned and type <code>make</code> to
compile. In order to launch QEmu with the Eulex image, run the script
<code>./run-eulex.sh</code>. If you pass any argument to this script, they are
passed to QEmu. It can be useful to enable sound, for example.</p>

<p>At this point, the system should boot as below. You can type Forth
code right there and it will be evaluated. Indeed, you can type TAB
key to autocomplete words, or use some emacs-like keybindings, e.g: </p>

<p><kbd>C-a</kbd>, <kbd>C-e</kbd>, <kbd>M-b</kbd>, <kbd>M-f</kbd>, <kbd>C-l</kbd>...</p>

<p><img src="/img/eulex/1.png" alt="eulex-screen-1"></p>

<p>By default, the context provides standard Forth words, but if you want
to hack the internals you will need access to the internal
vocabulary. Use the word <code>eulex</code> to do that. You can try to type
<code>words</code> to list all the words in a context. In the internal
vocabulary, there are about a thousand words.</p>

<p>It is possible to disassemble words, e.g: <code>see edit-line</code>. Note that
the disassembler uses the current context to look call addresses back
into word names. If many addresses are not showing, try moving to the
eulex vocabulary.</p>

<p><img src="/img/eulex/2.png" alt="eulex-screen-2"></p>

<p>There is not persistent storage, after halting QEmu, or rebooting with
the command <code>reboot</code>, changes will be lost. Therefore, you could want
to write code in the file <code>eulexrc.fs</code>, which is loaded automatically
when the system starts.</p>

<p>In closing, I would like to include a couple of nice pictures. The
first one is an incomplete screen block
<a href="https://github.com/davazp/eulex/blob/master/editor.fs">editor</a>,</p>

<p><img src="/img/eulex/3.png" alt="eulex-screen-3"></p>

<p>The second one is a
<a href="https://github.com/davazp/eulex/blob/master/lisp/lisp.fs">little Lisp interpreter</a>,
written in Forth.</p>

<p><img src="/img/eulex/4.png" alt="eulex-screen-3"></p>

<p>I hope you liked it. If you fancy hacking this and enjoy it as I did,
do not hesitate to write to me, I will help you with pleasure. There
many minor details, if you would like to try it but no to spend so
much time. If you feel adventurous, then the points to work are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bootstrapping</strong><br>
Rewriting forth.S as a crosscompiler to run on GForth, the 100% of the
code would be Forth. The system could compile itself eventually. The
<a href="https://github.com/davazp/eulex/blob/master/assembler.fs">assembler</a>
I wrote can be used to this task, as it executes both in Eulex as in
GForth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Improving the compiler</strong><br>
It is as native as described in this document. Code is very
inefficient. We could optimize it, but we do not want if the compiler
is written in assembler. So bootstraping should come first.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hard disk driver and FAT implementation.</strong><br>
Actually, files are stored built-in with the same Eulex image, so they
are read-only.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dumping and restoring the world</strong><br>
When the floppy driver or a file system implementation is working,
dumping the dictionary to the disk would have the nice effect ot
saving the whole state of the system.</p></li>
</ul>
